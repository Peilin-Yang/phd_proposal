\chapter{Boundary Theory of IR Ranking Models}

Various information retrieval models have been studied for decades. 
Most traditional retrieval models are based on bag-of-term 
representations, and they model the relevance based on various 
collection statistics, e.g. Term Frequency (TF), 
Inverted Document Frequency (IDF), Document Length (DL). 
Bag-of-term document representation and the statistics could be 
treated as the context of such ranking models.
Despite these efforts, it seems that the performance of 
``bag-of-term'' based retrieval functions has reached plateau, 
and it becomes increasingly difficult to further improve the retrieval 
performance. Thus, one important research question is whether 
we can provide any theoretical justifications on the empirical 
performance bound of basic retrieval functions. 

In our work, we start with single term queries, and aim to
estimate the performance bound of retrieval functions that
leverage only basic ranking signals such as document term
frequency, inverse document frequency and document length
normalization. Specifically, we demonstrate that, when only
single-term queries are considered, there is a general func-
tion that can cover many basic retrieval functions. We then
propose to estimate the upper bound performance of this
function by applying a cost/gain analysis to search for the
optimal value of the function.
