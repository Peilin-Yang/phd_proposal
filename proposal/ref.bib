abstract="Analysis on Web search query logs has revealed that there is a large portion of entity-bearing queries, reflecting the increasing demand of users on retrieving relevant information about entities such as persons, organizations, products, etc. In the meantime, significant progress has been made in Web-scale information extraction, which enables efficient entity extraction from free text. Since an entity is expected to capture the semantic content of documents and queries more accurately than a term, it would be interesting to study whether leveraging the information about entities can improve the retrieval accuracy for entity-bearing queries. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval approach, i.e., latent entity space (LES), which models the relevance by leveraging entity profiles to represent semantic content of documents and queries. In the LES, each entity corresponds to one dimension, representing one semantic relevance aspect. We propose a formal probabilistic framework to model the relevance in the high-dimensional entity space. Experimental results over TREC collections show that the proposed LES approach is effective in capturing latent semantic content and can significantly improve the search accuracy of several state-of-the-art retrieval models for entity-bearing queries.",

abstract     = {<p>A machine learning approach to learning to rank trains a model to optimize a
                target evaluation measure with repect to training data. Currently, existing
                information retrieval measures are impossible to optimize directly except for
                models with a very small number of parameters. The IR community thus faces a
                major challenge: how to optimize IR measures of interest directly. In this paper,
                we present a solution. Specifically, we show that LambdaRank [1], which smoothly
                approximates the gradient of the target measure, can be adapted to work with four
                popular IR target evaluation measures using the same underlying gradient
                construction. It is likely, therefore, that this construction is extendable to
                other evaluation measures. We empirically show that LambdaRank finds a locally
                optimal solution for mean NDCG@10, mean NDCG, MAP and MRR with a 99{\%} confidence
                rate. We also show that the amount of effective training data varies with IR
                measure and that with a sufficiently large training set size, matching the
                training optimization measure to the target evaluation measure yields the best
                accuracy.</p>},

title="Opinions matter: a general approach to user profile modeling for contextual suggestion",
journal="Information Retrieval Journal",
year="2015",
volume="18",
number="6",
pages="586--610",
abstract="The increasing use of mobile devices enables an information retrieval (IR) system to capitalize on various types of contexts (e.g., temporal and geographical information) about its users. Combined with the user preference history recorded in the system, a better understanding of users' information need can be achieved and it thus leads to improved user satisfaction. More importantly, such a system could proactively recommend suggestions based on the contexts. User profiling is essential in contextual suggestion. However, given most users' observed behaviors are sparse and their preferences are latent in an IR system, constructing accurate user profiles is generally difficult. In this paper, we focus on location-based contextual suggestion and propose to leverage users' opinions to construct the profiles. Instead of simply recording ``what places a user likes or dislikes'' in the past (i.e., description-based profile), we want to construct a profile to identify ``why a user likes or dislikes a place'' so as to better predict whether the user would like a new candidate suggestion of place. By assuming users would like or dislike a place with similar reasons, we construct the opinion-based user profile in a collaborative way: opinions from the other users are leveraged to estimate a profile for the target user. Candidate suggestions are represented in the same fashion and ranked based on their similarities with respect to the user profiles. Moreover, we also develop a novel summary generation method that utilizes the opinion-based user profiles to generate personalized and high-quality summaries for the suggestions. Experiments are conducted over three standard TREC contextual suggestion collections and a Yelp data set. Extensive experiment comparisons confirm that the proposed opinion-based user modeling outperforms the existing description-based methods. In particular, the systems developed based on the proposed methods have been ranked as top 1 in both TREC 2013 and 2014 contextual suggestion tracks.",
