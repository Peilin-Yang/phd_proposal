\chapter{Future Work}

For the future work, there are mainly two directions to explore more. 

The first one is to further investigate the impact of different contexts 
of unified IR evaluation system. One limitation of our current solution 
to this, namely RISE, only uses Indri as its underlying retrieval tool. 
It is more valuable for us to quantify the impact of using different 
tools, e.g. Lucene. 
We hope to be the first to report on standardizing and quantifying the 
impact so that the IR community could be aware of such divergence and can 
better evaluate the contributions of using various tools. 

The second direction is to provide more sound justification about the 
boundary theory of ranking model performance. Specifically, 
it is desirable to extend the current analysis on the 
single term queries to multiple term queries. One difficulty of this 
direction is that when there are multiple terms in the query there 
is basically no simplified form of a bunch of ranking models. 
This means that we need either change our method for multiple term 
queries or find some way to transform different ranking models to 
a unified form.
One way could be combining the axiomatic analysis with the 
explanatory analysis, where we can predict rough estimates.
