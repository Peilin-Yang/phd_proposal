In this thesis, we investigate the impact of context in different IR systems. 
Specifically, two kinds of systems are mainly explored. 
The first one is the unified evaluation system where the context is the 
evaluation system itself on which the comparison of different ranking models 
relies. Based on the unified evaluation system we tried to provide analytical 
performance upper bound for bag-of-terms ranking models. 
The other system is the contextual suggestion. The key of solving this 
problem is to build the user profile based on the user preference history 
so we include user preference history as part of the context of this problem. 
Extensive work have been done on solving these research questions. 
We now survey the related work in the literature and discuss the differences
with our proposed approaches in detail.
